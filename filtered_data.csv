2895,240,761,93,"Dear Ms. Cheney,

I’m late to the conversation, but let’s add some much-needed context to your stance on Ukraine by looking at the legacy you come from.

Your father, Dick Cheney, had a long and influential political career:

📌 Received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, citing “other priorities,” and never served in the military.
📌 Served in key government roles, including White House Chief of Staff (Ford), U.S. Representative (Wyoming), and Secretary of Defense (Bush Sr.).
📌 As Secretary of Defense, oversaw U.S. military interventions in Panama and Iraq (Desert Storm).
📌 Led Halliburton as chairman and CEO (1995–2000), a company that later secured massive defense contracts in war zones.
📌 As Vice President, was a principal advocate for the 2003 Iraq invasion, citing claims that proved to be false.
📌 Accumulated a net worth reportedly reaching $86 million largely due to Halliburton.

These are facts. Neither you nor your father served in the military, yet he played a leading role in sending Americans into war—many of whom returned disabled, traumatized, or never returned at all. He and you profited immensely from the war machine while veterans struggled for the benefits they earned.

Despite this, you now position yourself as a leading voice on Ukraine. Why should anyone take your stance seriously, given your personal and family history of benefiting from military conflicts? Talk about the biggest conflict of interest ever.

So, before demanding action on Ukraine with emotional appeals, perhaps you should address the far more relevant issue: Why should anyone believe that your position is anything other than a continuation of the same war-profiteering playbook your family has long followed?",True,True,False,,2025-03-04T11:23:00.000Z,,@DataRepublican,True

5239,137,2006,57,"NEW ARTICLE: IVERMECTIN and FENBENDAZOLE Testimonial - 63 year old woman (USA) with Stage 2 Fallopian Tube Cancer becomes cancer free - Oncologist: ""in his whole career he has never seen anything like it""

Disclaimer:
I am debanked by Stripe
My @X Ad revenue is being stolen
My Sub..stack revenue is being stolen
My @GiveSendGo was raided
My @X Account was hacked 
Alberta government ordered all of the above to bankrupt me, silence me and break me.

So naturally I'm doubling down 😃. Let's Go!

63 year old patient with a high grade serous Fallopian Tube Cancer asked me for help.

They put her on chemo but we implemented:

Ivermectin 1mg/kg/day escalating to 2mg/kg/day
Fenbendazole 444mg/day to 1332mg/day

A month after starting Ivermectin/Fenbendazole Protocol she had surgery and had some cancer cells in the abdominal wash.

She restarted the Ivermectin/Fenbendazole Protocol

A few weeks later during HIPEC surgery, they couldn't find any cancer cells.

Here is the patient's recounting of the story:

""I saw the hematologist yesterday and he said no one at the tumor board could understand why the fluid showed no cancer.""

""He said in his whole career he has never seen anything like it. So rare to see such a thing. Then I told him that I went on Ivermectin and he laughed. He hopes @RobertKennedyJr  can get this legalized in the states and that I should share this news with the other doctors and surgeon that performed this surgery""

""He said his other patients are taking Ivermectin with chemo now"".

Did you hear that? 😃

That's the sound of the Overton Window shifting.

This is the cutting edge of cancer treatments.
Right here. Effecting change.

I have to admit, I'm impressed how calm everybody is about STRIPE debanking me for helping cancer patients become cancer free. 😮

If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone on @X. But everyone seems very comfortable with it.

Then again, there is only one place where you find cancer success stories like this, so it's natural they come after me and not the Krassenstein brothers. 😂

Did you know Alberta taxpayers paid over $10 million for that raid on my STRIPE account and they had to bribe 5 Trudeau appointed Judges to make it happen! 

Wait...wasn't @MarkJCarney on the Board of STRIPE? Canada's next Prime Minister? 🤔

Ah well, another Cancer Free patient! 
And that's all that matters. 😃

Reading the book taught me a lot about the complex craft of writing comedy and sit-coms in particular - Linehan is, of course, the co-creator of Father Ted, Black Books, The IT Crowd and a host of other  much loved shows. He has a string of Baftas to his name.

But ""Tough Crowd"" is also full of hugely disturbing material about ""the culture wars"", recounting how this comedy legend has been chewed up and spat out by an artistic and media establishment, including many of his former coilleagues and friends.

Why? Because so many cowardly individuals have refused to accept Linehan's right to stand up for his views relating to gender and sexuality – views that are not only perfectly acceptable but are held by the overwhelming majority of the UK population.

Graham Linehan is an enormously talented writer. He is also a brave and deeply principled man. I am proud to know him - and recommend his book whole-heartedly.

If you look at the future obligations of Social Security, it far exceeds the tax revenue. 

The actual national debt is like double what people think it is because of the future obligations. 

People are living way longer than expected, and there are fewer babies being born, so you have more people who are retired that live for a long time and get retirement payments.

45,2,22,0,"In a riveting speech yesterday, our least popular prime minister since Liz Truss might have saved his political career… I mean neoliberalism… I mean freedom and democracy… 

Sir Keir Starmer stood in front of Downing Street and proudly announced his World War III plans… I mean peace plans to rapturous applause. The prime minister truly rose to the occasion, looking statesman-like by wearing a suit while saying he takes nuking millions of humans very seriously.

This could so easily have been an awkward announcement because Trump had left Starmer in a difficult position by dropping support for Ukraine to focus on his favourite conflict: the Gaza genocide. This was not for any moral reason, it’s just the US is short of bombs and Trump is prioritising his resources to respect the wishes of his donors.

Worryingly, Trump pretended to give a shit about peace in Ukraine which meant Starmer had to also pretend to have a conscience. The prime minister had no choice but to feign interest in peace, but the very thought of peace made his skin crawl. He could not even hide his disgust at the idea.

The world is incredibly screwed when you can express support for starving civilians in Gaza, and send weapons into a genocide, but you get flack for supporting a morally ambiguous conflict in Ukraine, isn’t it?

Thankfully, Starmer’s advisors came up with a brilliant strategy: mumble something about peace then invoke the Iraq war and talk about non-peaceful things so you look like a statesman. This is exactly what Starmer did and it made all the male journalists around me positively aroused. I swear Jon Sopel ejaculated at one point, but nobody judged him.

Starmer took the moral and intellectual high ground by doing his best George Bush jr impression and talking of a “coalition of the willing”. Just don’t mention the last time we did one of those it was in strict violation of international law and over a million people died.

Starmer pledged boots on the ground and planes in the air, even though his own military chiefs told him he doesn’t have enough boots to put on the ground or planes to put in the air! What matters is Starmer got to look tough and compensate for his domestic failings.

I’m no expert on the military, or any subject for that matter, but I know one of Putin’s key objections was the West building a military presence in Ukraine. Therefore, Russia will not be able to resist shooting at our troops and we can then say we are fighting a war of self-defence. Putting our troops in harm’s way is tactical genius!

Let's ignore that Putin’s weapons production capacity is five times greater than all of NATO’s combined, and he has Oreshniks. We wouldn’t want our soldiers having second thoughts, would we? I mean war is Starmer’s only hope of boosting his poll numbers and it would be deeply unfair if he missed the opportunity to be our next Churchill. You remember the dog? He was sadly euthanised by Kim Leadbetter.

Don’t worry, Starmer insisted we’re only going to fight Russia with US support, so please disregard that the US won’t be providing support. That’s an insignificant detail that should have no bearing on anything.

Outrageously, Nigel Farage asked Starmer in parliament how many troops he will be deploying in Ukraine, given that we are woefully short on manpower. Thankfully, Starmer evaded the question by saying, “Shut up you Putin-loving commie idiot!” Farage was deeply insulted by this outburst because neither of these men know what commie means.

Our woefully underfunded military doesn’t have much of anything. Even our Trident missiles can’t fire straight, and they can’t fire at all without the help of the US. Good luck trying to get Trump to help with that! We have the world’s worst nuclear deterrent and we can’t blame budget cuts because we used the money allocated for hungry school kids, homeless and disabled people. Trident is where our budget went!

Anyways, how are your sparrow hunting skills? Because you sure as hell won’t be getting any war rations in this time of ruthless austerity. Rations will be seen as another state handout for Rachel Reeves to cut so she looks tough in front of her donors. If you want food, you will have to volunteer for the front line, okay grandma?

Just be assured that when you reach the front line, we don’t have any spare guns. You will therefore be expected to bring your own weapon to Ukraine. A bit of old gardening equipment should do the job, maybe a rake. And something sharp for your least favourite limb because you’re gonna be sawing it off in the trenches and crawling away with a bloody stump. Good luck!

Obviously, we are gonna keep the war going for as long as possible and help Ukraine reclaim all of its land, but if you suggest doing the same for Palestine, you are a terrible person! I mean what kind of lunatic would fight for brown people?

All I know is we can’t let a madman take all of the land around him in a genocidal rampage, unless his name is Benjamin Netanyahu. Everyone knows the correct thing to do is wage war against countries that illegally invade white countries. Thankfully, we in the West are not continuously illegally invading any countries.

We have the highest of moral high grounds and we have no choice but to fight another forever war. The worry is that if we agree to peace, there might later be war, so we should have war without trying peace because this is the only way to achieve peace. This is the most coherent argument any of us could think of yesterday and the average salary at the conference was £450,000!

We just know we want war and I’m not sure the words matter as long as we’re all saying exactly the same thing on your TV screens and ensuring there is no room for dissenting opinions. I think it’s extremely important we don’t consider any of the consequences of a world war.

If you’re a middle-class parent of fighting age children, aged 16 to 60, male or female, just tell yourself working class lads will be doing all the dying. Hopefully, we can remove affluent post codes from the system so only council estate riffraff are sent to their deaths. Only the people who don’t matter should die in this war, and I’m sure you will agree that I certainly do matter.

I, as a mainstream journalist, have convinced myself that I am immune to all types of radiation. I have no science to back this up, but I’m happy to remain in denial of the reality of the thing I’m cheering for. I’m under no illusions that you lot are fucked though. 

Get ready for your septum to fall off when you pick your nose! Get ready for your lips to come off when you cough! Before you know it, you’re gonna be looking like a ghoul from Fallout whereas I shall be looking as pretty as ever, and that is all that matters x

It is more than a career or ambition; it is an inner force that compels meaningful action, often aligned with natural talents, values, or a higher purpose. A calling is not just something one chooses - it is something that seems to choose them, lingering even if ignored. It is an instinct, a pull toward something greater, and it often feels like something one cannot turn away from.

Unlike a career, which is chosen for practical reasons like income or stability, a calling is something one pursues regardless of external rewards. A job pays the bills, but a calling fulfills the soul. A job is what you do, but a calling is who you are. Some are fortunate enough to turn their calling into a career, while others follow their calling even when it brings no financial gain.

Callings manifest in different ways. Some feel a spiritual calling, drawing them toward enlightenment or faith. Others experience a creative calling, an inner need to express something through art, music, or writing. Some are called to serve others, becoming teachers, healers, or guides. Others feel a leadership calling, driven to change systems, innovate, or inspire movements. A calling is often linked to one’s deepest values and how they wish to impact the world.

A true calling is both exhilarating and burdensome. It may go against societal expectations, requiring sacrifice, isolation, or struggle. It can be painful to ignore, as if betraying one’s true self. This is why some resist their calling, fearing the responsibility it demands. But a true calling never truly disappears - it waits, pressing on the soul until answered.

Recognizing a calling often comes through repeated themes in life, moments of deep clarity, or a sense of restlessness that does not fade. One may feel completely absorbed in an activity, experiencing a flow state, as if they were made for it. A calling is rarely easy, nor does it come with certainty, but it carries a sense of conviction and meaning that transcends logic.

A calling is not a destination but a journey, shaping not only what one does but who they become in the pursuit of it. It is the whisper of the soul, leading one toward something greater than themselves.

884,42,163,5,"This has got to stop. The criticism of Bruno Fernandes, the standard that he is being held to is insane. These opinions aren't even based in anything factual.

@StephenWarnock3 just said this about @B_Fernandes8, in an attempt to build his own career off of Bruno's back:

- only plays well when losing & is not brave
- he doesn't do it all the time
- he doesn't do it in the hardest moments
- he'd like to play against him
- doesn't track back, easy to play against
- teams run off the back of him

There's no pressure when you're behind? There's ALWAYS pressure. It's Manchester United. This exact treatment shows there's pressure. And pretending that's the only time he plays well is barely addressable.

To say Bruno Fernandes is not brave with the injuries he has played through is laughable. He helped beat Liverpool in last season's FA Cup on one bloody leg.

He isn't consistent? Bruno Fernandes is one of the most consistent footballers on the planet. That's why he has 20, 45, 24, 28, 28 & 24 goals/assists in each season at the club. He quite literally does it all the time.

The biggest moments? I guess one of the games he didn't watch was the FA Cup Final last season. Or at the Etihad this season, or at Anfield against Warnock's old club. He's shown up in all of the biggest moments.

Warnock would like to play against him? He couldn't lace Fernandes' boots. That's why he bounced around playing for all of Manchester United's rivals after not being good enough to play for Liverpool.

As for the tracking back comments, if anyone has shown defensive work rate it's Bruno Fernandes. He was tracking back deeper than any non-defender last night, including after 100 minutes when his teammates were cramping. His work rate is unquestionable.

Any ex-player looking for work when they retire can just go to Sky. As long as they have an opinion they are good to go, it doesn't even need to be true.",False,True,True,"🗣️ ""Such a talented player on the ball but off the ball he's nowhere near good enough""

Giggled and laughed like she didn’t know all this stuff existed until a source told her. 

Even though she was the Attorney General of Florida and knew all about Jeffrey Epstein. 

Even though there were tapes out, showing the files and boxes taken from the island. 

Even though she gave a deadline of 8 AM on Friday. Yet never came out publicly until she ran to Sean Hannity to tell him the story.

As far as this, American is concerned, she has tarnished her reputation. 

She lied and she keeps running to Fox, Fox is not the American people, Fox’S is a news network. 

Maybe she needs to go to work for Fox. 

Her statement is they will work as fast as they can. Well you know Sessions used to say that and Barr used to say that so we probably won’t see anything for four years.

But she’s working on it even though she lied to the American people and misled them.

She has tarnished her name and lost the trust of a lot of Americans.

The best thing that could happen is that Trump fires her and starts over with somebody that we can trust that won’t run to Fox to try to save her career. 

If she wants to make a statement, she should make it publicly at a news conference, which should’ve happened Friday.

She doesn’t listen to all the background noise and everything well Pam, the background noise is the American people that you misled and broke their trust.

@AGPamBondi is not worthy of such a high position. She would rather be Sean Hannity’s anchor.

He’s making quite a habit of it, in fact. And on the energy file, he’s being especially misleading, walking back his long-time support of the Carbon Tax — he’s said it has “served a purpose up until now” — and claiming that he intends to repeal it, while finding other ways to “make polluters pay.”

This is nonsense. In fact, Carney is a Carbon Tax superfan, and, if you listen to him closely, his actual critique of the Trudeau tax isn’t that it has made it more expensive to heat our homes, gas up our cars, and pay for our groceries (which it has.) It’s that it is too visible to voters. His vow to “make polluters pay” means, in fact, that he intends to “beef up” Trudeau’s less discussed Industrial Carbon Tax, targeting businesses, which will ultimately pass the cost down to consumers."" @GasPriceWizard  todayville.com/carneys-carbo…",False,True,False,,2025-03-04T00:21:00.000Z,,@cbcwatcher,True

650,27,66,9,"Andrea Berta, born January 1, 1972, in Brescia, Italy, began his career outside football as a banker before transitioning into the sports world in his early 30s. His entry into football came through a connection with Cesare Prandelli’s cousin, who gave him an opportunity at the lower-league Italian club AC Carpenedolo.
From 2002 to 2006, Berta served as sporting director at Carpenedolo, impressing with his meticulous approach, including extensive scouting trips like one to South America where he watched 25 players in 10 days. This dedication caught the attention of bigger clubs in Italy.
In 2007, Berta joined Parma as sporting director, spending two years honing his skills in Serie A before moving to Genoa in 2009. At Genoa, until 2012, he continued to build his reputation as a shrewd operator in the transfer market.
Berta’s big break came in 2013 when he joined Atlético Madrid, initially as a scout and technical director, recommended by Peter Kenyon to club president Enrique Cerezo. His early work focused on international scouting, laying the groundwork for significant signings.
In 2017, Berta was promoted to sporting director at Atlético Madrid, replacing José Luis Pérez Caminero, a role he held until January 6, 2025. Under his leadership, the club transformed into a European powerhouse, competing consistently with Real Madrid and Barcelona.
Berta’s tenure at Atlético saw the club win two La Liga titles (2013/14, 2020/21), two Europa League titles (2011/12, 2017/18), two UEFA Super Cups (2012/13, 2018/19), a Copa del Rey (2012/13), and a Spanish Super Cup (2013/14). The team also reached two Champions League finals (2014, 2016).
His transfer market successes include signing world-class talents like Antoine Griezmann, Jan Oblak, João Félix, Rodri, and Julián Álvarez, several of whom became World Cup winners or award recipients. Griezmann and Oblak, in particular, were acquired for modest fees and later sold or valued at massive profits.
Berta’s relationship with agent Jorge Mendes facilitated high-profile deals, while his ability to retain manager Diego Simeone through tensions with the club hierarchy ensured stability. His strategic vision elevated Atlético’s competitiveness on a global stage.
In 2019, Berta was named Best Sporting Director of the Year at the Globe Soccer Awards, and in 2021, he won the Premio Maestelli, recognizing his exceptional contributions to football management. His work drew interest from clubs like PSG, Manchester United, and Juventus.
After 11 years at Atlético Madrid, Berta left in early 2025, having left a legacy of trophies and transformative signings. His career reflects a journey from banking to becoming one of football’s most respected sporting directors, marked by astute recruitment and sustained success.",True,True,False,,2025-03-03T07:57:00.000Z,,@PrimeOdegaard,True

This question changed @brianondrako's life - and it might change yours too.

In my latest conversation with Brian, he shared the exact moment that transformed his journey:

➤ Buried in debt after his employer went bankrupt
➤ Feeling stuck in a career that no longer fulfilled him
➤ Forced to make a choice: stay stuck or take control

Brian chose to take control, and that decision completely transformed his trajectory.

He revealed his powerful COMPASS framework that guided him forward:
• Commitment
• Objective
• Mindset
• Priorities
• Accountability 
• Support
• Start

Sowjanya’s career has been a journey of discovery—figuring out what didn’t excite her was just as important as finding what did. She started in banking, then spent three years in marketing at Unilever, but it wasn’t until she stumbled into the impact space that something clicked.

Her first full-time foray into social impact was at Girl Effect, where she saw firsthand how innovative solutions could transform the lives of young girls. She thrived in the challenge of building from the ground up and loved working alongside people deeply driven by purpose. Scaling a small team into something bigger gave her a taste of the 0-to-1 journey—and she was hooked. As Director, #ACTForWomen and #ACTForEducation, she brings that same builder’s mindset to venture philanthropy, especially at the intersection(s) of gender, education and impact.

Sowjanya thrives in ACT’s culture of collaboration and loves working with the team, which she describes as consisting of sharp, mission-driven minds who push each other to think bigger and do better every day. Beyond work, she has a unique ability to keep the team grounded—bringing perspective, balance, and quiet strength that makes the work more meaningful.

Sowjanya envisions a future where dignity and respect aren’t privileges but guarantees—where rising aspirations are met with real opportunities, and she's committed to unlocking the opportunities for many.

0,0,0,0,"Throughout my professional career in YouTube, people have come to me perhaps hundreds of times with the idea of “Should we create a channel like this?”. I’m sure many of those reading this article also have such an idea in mind.

Unfortunately, most people don’t know how to evaluate the ideas they come up with. To help you decide whether these ideas are worth turning into reality, I have a very simple formula. You can ask yourself the same questions I ask those who approach me with their ideas:

Has this idea already been done hundreds of times?

Examples:
• Let’s invite famous guests and have conversations.
• Let’s compile and share the week’s news.
• Let’s write funny sketches.

If an idea has been done hundreds of times, it means that space is highly saturated. As a result, competition is high, and your chances of success are low. If you are determined to pursue this field, you need to differentiate yourself. However, your differentiation should not be based on superficial aspects (such as personality or looks) but on a meaningful value proposition.

Examples:
• Let’s invite famous guests and ask them absurd questions (e.g., Between Two Ferns).
• Let’s present the week’s news with humor (e.g., Late Night Shows).
• Let’s write absurd yet clever sketches (e.g., Cunk on Earth).

If the idea hasn’t been done before, is there an audience demand for it?

Examples:
• Let’s invite famous guests and cook together (Sounds good, but it combines two different audience types and doesn’t offer a clear value to either).
• Let’s create a news channel that only shares literature-related news (Is there really a successful example of this?).
• Let’s write vintage comedy sketches (nostalgic romanticism).

So yes, the idea might excite you when it first comes to mind, or it might feel like a brilliant concept. But unfortunately, it may not resonate with an audience. To minimize risk, here are two approaches you can take:

1. Are there similar ideas in other niches, and how were they received?
For example, if you have an idea for a unique tennis-related content format, check if a similar concept exists in football and whether it has attracted an audience.

2. Test the idea by explaining it in one or two sentences to those around you.
If it grabs their attention, elaborate a little more. Observe their curiosity and excitement levels. If you consistently see genuine interest and engagement, consider testing the idea further. Without spending too much money, record and edit a small sample and ask yourself: Would I watch this? Then show it to others and gauge their reactions.

At this point, the decision is yours.

If you publish the content, produce at least 10-20 videos. If, despite this effort, you’re not getting meaningful views, it probably means the idea doesn’t resonate with the audience.

If you’re still unsure about your idea, feel free to reach me out for consultancy.",False,False,False,,2025-03-04T12:39:00.000Z,,@fazilisler_eng,True

578,57,41,25,"Chennedy Carter’s career has been anything but smooth. In just a few short years, she’s suited up for the Atlanta Dream, Los Angeles Sparks, and Chicago Sky — three teams, three stops, and three times her talent couldn’t fully drown out the noise. When a player moves that often, it’s easy for the word “attitude” to stick, and Carter’s name has rarely been mentioned without it.

It would be simple to write her off as too much trouble to take on — but talent like hers doesn’t come around often, and that’s the part no one can ignore. Carter isn’t just a quick bucket; she’s a player who changes the tempo and flow of a game the moment she steps on the floor. Last season, she averaged (17.5) points and (3.1) assists in just 25 minutes per game — production that most players can’t touch even with a starting role. Offensively, there’s no question what she brings.

The hesitation, of course, comes from everything off the court. Reports of locker room tension, clashes with teammates, and questions about her coachability have followed her across the league. That’s the reality — but it doesn’t have to be the end of the story.

Growth doesn’t happen in isolation. It happens when the right environment meets the right talent — when a coach, a front office, and a veteran core believe that a player’s gifts are worth the work it takes to bring out their best. Carter doesn’t need a team to hand her the keys to the franchise. What she needs is a team willing to coach her, challenge her, and believe in her growth the same way they believe in her game.

At some point, teams in need of offensive firepower must decide if they’re willing to pass on a player of Carter's caliber based solely on her reputation. In a league where scoring talent is highly coveted, leaving Carter unsigned is its own gamble — one that a savvy team might be ready to take on.",False,True,False,,2025-03-03T19:16:00.000Z,,@trendyhoopstars,True

0,0,0,0,"I found myself in a bar one time, shooting pool. I ran into a psychologist who owned a real classy brewery down the road from my parents' house. We got to talking, initially about pool, but then his career came up outside of his business, and psychology as a whole.

At some point me being the ... whatever you want to call it that I am, I brought up depression. And his response was super fascinating to me. And this is the gist of what he said.

He said during his time in school, he was doing a variety of projects where he worked with actual patients that claimed to have depression. Clinical Depression. He proceeded to tell a variety of stories and gave a series of examples, coming to the conclusion that... The vast majority, he claimed over 90% of depression cases are not clinical depression. They are not the chemical imbalance in your brain, causing intense sadness and of course... depression. Although they do exist.

But the majority of the cases had one problem in common in their lives. They were missing something. Almost all of people's depression was a result of something that either they didn't have and wanted, lifestyle, finances, social status, relationships, death, etc. It was the result of something missing in that person's life. Which is awesome. Because that means you can treat it without getting on a pill. Which I would argue is a good path lol.

I personally am still in the process of figuring this out. And I very well may be for the rest of my life as I continue to set the bar higher and higher, unexplainably not by choice. We are all capable of doing quite literally whatever the hell we want. Many of us are just lazy. Yeah you. Depressed because you are unhealthy? The only thing most likely stopping you from being healthy is you. Stop the sugar, smaller portions, go outside. Only you can do that. And only you can stop you from doing that. Financially STUCK and it's giving you depression? Step it back a bit, pick up some hours, budget a bit, cancel those damn subscriptions, get a new job, heck, you could start a side hustle. LLC's are cheap, and you GOTTA be good at something right? And someone out there will probably pay you to do it. Definitely don't do crypto.

What I am saying if it isn't obvious. Is the old cliche saying, ""You can do anything you put your mind to"" is... Frickin wait for it ... Actually fkn true. You just CAN'T be lazy. You got to give it 100% mentally. Honestly. You got to give it 100% percent psychically. Honestly. Don't lie to yourself, hold yourself accountable.  And only you can really do that. And only you can really stop yourself from doing that.

Come on. Chin up, back straight. Broad shoulders... It's 2025 and you we aren't getting anyyyyyy younger. Time to kick some ass. 🤜🤛",False,False,True,"Depression isn’t a chemical imbalance, it’s a thought imbalance.",2025-03-04T13:11:00.000Z,2025-03-02T00:52:00.000Z,@UPNorth_Kurt,True

I went to speak with the president. He didn’t give me much time and just told me I no longer fit into their plans and that they wanted to win the Champions League.

Before leaving his office, I said: 'Sir, know that wherever I go, I will play to win.'

Two days later, Mourinho called me. I think he got my number through Chivu, because I didn’t know him personally before.

He said: 'Wesley, I know your situation there is tough. Come to Inter and together we will win everything.'

With Mourinho, it was love at first sight. He assured me I was one of the most important players on his team and that together we would win the Champions League. Maybe he said that to everyone, but trust me, one year with him feels like ten with someone else.

1.Where to Address It?
•Resume: If the gap is recent or significant (6+ months), include a brief explanation (e.g., “Professional Development | Completed [Relevant Course]” or “Career Transition | Focused on Skill Building in [New Industry]”).
•Cover Letter: If the gap is due to personal reasons (health, caregiving, etc.), briefly acknowledge it while shifting focus to your skills and enthusiasm for the role.
•Interview: If asked, be honest but frame it positively—highlight what you learned or how it prepared you for the job.

Career Pivots
1.How to Transition into a New Industry with Unrelated Experience?
•Identify Transferable Skills: Soft skills (problem-solving, leadership, communication) and hard skills (data analysis, project management) can often apply across industries.
•Get Certified or Take Courses: Online platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or LinkedIn Learning can help bridge knowledge gaps.
•Gain Practical Experience: Freelance, volunteer, or work on projects that demonstrate your ability in the new field.
•Rewrite Your Resume for the New Industry: Highlight relevant achievements, even if they come from a different field. Use industry keywords to align with job descriptions.
•Network in the New Industry: Join LinkedIn groups, attend industry events, and connect with professionals who can guide you.

5,0,2,0,The most articulate takedown of a warmongering neocon in quite a while. This should remove all doubt and should end the political career of @Liz_Cheney.,True,True,True,"Dear Ms. Cheney,

I’m late to the conversation, but let’s add some much-needed context to your stance on Ukraine by looking at the legacy you come from.

Your father, Dick Cheney, had a long and influential political career:

📌 Received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, citing “other priorities,” and never served in the military.
📌 Served in key government roles, including White House Chief of Staff (Ford), U.S. Representative (Wyoming), and Secretary of Defense (Bush Sr.).
📌 As Secretary of Defense, oversaw U.S. military interventions in Panama and Iraq (Desert Storm).
📌 Led Halliburton as chairman and CEO (1995–2000), a company that later secured massive defense contracts in war zones.
📌 As Vice President, was a principal advocate for the 2003 Iraq invasion, citing claims that proved to be false.
📌 Accumulated a net worth reportedly reaching $86 million largely due to Halliburton.

These are facts. Neither you nor your father served in the military, yet he played a leading role in sending Americans into war—many of whom returned disabled, traumatized, or never returned at all. He and you profited immensely from the war machine while veterans struggled for the benefits they earned.

So, before demanding action on Ukraine with emotional appeals, perhaps you should address the far more relevant issue: Why should anyone believe that your position is anything other than a continuation of the same war-profiteering playbook your family has long followed?",2025-03-04T12:13:00.000Z,2025-03-04T11:23:00.000Z,@onenoblerogue,True

Fortunately, growth is a subject I find very interesting.

John Maxwell says: 

“…growth is the only guarantee that tomorrow will be better than today”

The only assurance that you’re going to go far in anything you do, is your growth in that thing.

Moreover, career growth stems from personal growth and development.

As you advance in your career path, and in your quest to niche down, one of the things you’d need to do is discover your skills, personal values, and areas of strengths.

These things will aid you in building your philosophies and understanding your path.

Not everything might work for you honestly.

Hence to grow yourself you must know yourself!

Especially in a space so vast like the Web3 space.

“I didn’t grow up in a volleyball family and started playing at school, not a club. When I got into the game, I looked up to stars like Luciano De Cecco, Seba Solé, and Facu Conte. I played as a middle blocker, and Seba was always amazing at it, one of the best in the world. He became the person I admired the most. Later, I joined the national team with Seba, and it was great. I learned what an incredible person he is, and we became close friends. His drive to play inspired me, and I try to live volleyball the same way. I always thought it would be amazing to play in a league with him, and now we’re together at Perugia, which makes me very happy. It’s not just about the game; it’s also about the friendship and enjoying life with him and his family.""

""After last season, I knew I had the most blocks, but I didn’t expect to win best player. I found out before the first match with Perugia when they presented the trophies. It was strange because I was focused on doing my best for the team. I don’t usually think about individual awards, but when I see them at home, I remind myself to appreciate those accomplishments. Of course, the team’s success is the priority, but I can’t ignore personal recognition.

➖➖➖
Armenian tennis star Elina Avanesyan has achieved a new career milestone, acheiving an all-time high ranking of No. 39 in the latest Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) singles rankings. This marks the first time she has broken into the Top 40, further solidifying her status as Armenia’s top-ranked female tennis player, reports Zartonk Media.

The WTA, the global governing body for professional women’s tennis, released its latest world rankings this week, with Avanesyan jumping six spots to secure her new career-best position. This achievement comes after an impressive semifinal run at the WTA 500 Mérida Open Akron in Mexico, where she defeated No. 7 seed Magdalena Frech and Jessica Bouzas Maneiro before falling to top seed Emma Navarro (USA) in straight sets (6-3, 6-3).

Avanesyan, who previously competed under the Russian flag, officially began representing Armenia in August 2024. This transition highlights her deep Armenian heritage, as she was born in Russia to Armenian parents and has since embraced the opportunity to compete for the country of her ancestors. Her decision to switch nationalities has received widespread support from the Armenian community, further establishing her as a rising star in the sport.

At the top of the WTA rankings, Iga Swiatek (Poland) currently holds the No. 1 spot, followed by Aryna Sabalenka (Belarus) at No. 2 and Coco Gauff (USA) at No. 3.",False,True,False,,2025-03-03T21:47:00.000Z,,@ZartonkMedia,True

Want to move up in your career? It’s not just about working hard and hoping someone notices—it’s about demonstrating next-level leadership.

Here’s how you know you’re ready for the next level:

1️⃣ You Drive Impact, Not Just Activity

It’s not about doing the most—it’s about delivering real, measurable, and impactful results.

✅ Your contribution creates meaningful and measurable change.

2️⃣ You Elevate Others, Not Just Yourself

If you up-level others, it’s a triple-win situation. You, the person you helped, and the company all benefit.

✅ You invest in others and everybody wins.

3️⃣ You Build Durable Trust

If leadership can depend on you (instead of babysitting you), you’ll be trusted with more scope.

✅ Colleagues and leaders know they can rely on you.

4️⃣ You Solve Hard Problems, Not Just Complete Tasks

Lower performers are assigned tasks. High performers identify and solve hairy problems.

✅ You proactively identify challenges and deliver solutions that impact the business.

5️⃣ You Show Emotional Intelligence, Not Just Expertise

Technical skills get you in the door—high EQ enables you lead.

✅ You navigate tough situations with composure and bring people together.

The bottom line?

Being ready for a promotion isn’t about tenure—it’s about impact, influence, and leadership.

60,8,4,2,"I wrote over 70,000 words, spanning a 15 year career as a motorsport mechanic.

I spoke about my own experiences with the sports lack of diversity. I spoke about the mental health implications for those that travel all season through a gruelling calendar.  I spoke about the death of Jules Bianchi, the impact it had not only on me, and how the safety of the sport has improved as a result. I spoke about a cost cap that is killing the meritocracy of the job market in the sport and driving the best, most valuable personnel into other industries. 

I also spoke about a very personal experience I had relating to the biases and double standards that women face working in the sport. 

I expected, upon the public release of ‘Life In The Pitlane’, that some of these issues raised might garner attention from fans of the sport and those already working in it or aspiring to do so. That’s kinda the idea of writing a book. I tried to be very honest, and also fair, in expressing my views and opinions about the industry, in the hope that it would provide insight and insipre. In doing so, I of course knew that it might also open me up to criticism. 

I also understood that there’d be a small corner of F1 twitter that would, of course, find any opportunity to be critical. 

I want to be unequivocally clear about one thing…

If ANY of the people I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside for the last 15 years, those who understand and have experienced a life in racing, had read my book and expressed concerns or issues with any its content, I would be absolutely mortified. Thankfully, that hasn’t been the case, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I’m very proud of the book we produced. 

What I will say is that if you think that taking a 10 second excerpt out of a 15 year career and think that it provides you with the insight to offer any opinion of value, you’re sorely mistaken. 

All I ask is that you read ‘Life In The Pitlane’ in its entirety, put your fandom to one side, and try to offer something constructive to the conversation.

Think about it:

But here's the REAL power: Once you master this skill, you've unlocked a lifetime of independence. You control your time, your income, your life.

I’m purposely not naming the team, as not to directly call the team out. I’m just sharing that this coach’s personal assessment is the direct opposite from how Sanders came across to many reporters in his press conference with the media at the Combine. Sanders appeared to go out of his way to acknowledge multiple media members, regardless if they were recognizable or not. He seemed cordial, polite, witty, thoughtful along with being confident (as many athletes are). Alternately, these observations were distinctly different from how another QB prospect came off to some in the media last year in Indy.

According to league sources, said QB coach seems to have issue with “the culture” of athletes who have broad fame and financial success before entering the NFL, and in their* opinions, appears to them to have a problem certain athletes—I’ll leave it at that.

This is how pre-Draft evaluations can get jacked because of evaluators who don’t seemingly possess the discernment to detect intangible traits that are connected to the will and drive to win without being a stat, or delineated in an analytics report. 

He’s literally Deion Sanders’ son, and despite growing up different from most, seemed fairly grounded. 

Hopefully any potential biases towards “the culture” are being checked at the door, as not to unduly impact stock & business. The modern day college athelete is evolving, as is the scale of business and opportunities surrounding them before entering professional leagues.

76,9,10,2,"Smoking Gun
This situation with Dr. Michael Brown is so sad because all he needed to do was confess to his elders and submit to discipline 23 years ago. He could’ve even done that in October 2024. It was not a career-ending sin—but the two inappropriate relationships were things you couldn’t move on from without elder involvement. In October, I pleaded with Mike via email—and the investigator has those emails—to deal with the issue forthrightly. The tone of those back-and-forth emails was one of love and compassion. You will see it in the investigator report. Anyone who thinks I have a grudge or vendetta needs to read those emails.

(Just a few months ago, I hosted Mike and Ryan, his son-in-law, in Israel, and we had a wonderful time. I took them to Southern Israel, and we filmed at the scene of the tragic attacks at the Supernova Concert on October 7, and then I treated them both to lunch. When he was accused in 2018 by another Israeli leader of being a false prophet, I forcefully defended him publicly and privately. So, no, this has nothing to do with a vendetta. It’s about righteousness and victims.)

As a younger brother, I offered in October 2024 to walk with him through a healing process. “I would gladly help you process this,” I wrote. But he had no interest.

Then it turned ugly.

He told my peer leaders in Tikkun that I was trying to destroy his life and ministry and that I was being used by Satan to keep him from his efforts to bring revival and cultural reformation.

In addition to confessing to me and two others to much of the accusations—he sent a text message to a mutual pastor friend, who then forwarded it to me. There are at least five lies in this text, and maybe more. But the most important part is that Mike says his version of what happened in these relationships “mirrors” what Sarah shared with Kris Bennett in a series of texts in 2020.

(see attached)

Lie #1: “[Sarah’s] story changed dramatically from 4 1/2 years ago when she shared everything with a grad.”

Truth #1: Sarah had Kris send me those texts in early November after she shared her story with me. I sought her out after Dr. Brown rejected efforts to help him deal with these allegations properly. Her account of today matches her account of 2020 100%, except for one detail. The one detail is that in the texts (the first time she shared the truth with anyone after 18 years), she says Mike kissed her on the forehead and cheek. It is very common for abuse victims to leave out some of the more egregious details the first time they disclose, but Sarah only left out one—that, in addition to kissing on the forehead and cheek, Mike began to ask for a kiss on the lips at the end of each workday. Other than that, her narrative to me and the Roys Report (TRR) completely matches the 2020 texts. Why else would TRR link to those texts if they told a different story?

In addition, in a letter to Tikkun leaders complaining about me in November, Dr. Brown referred to Sarah as a ""demonstrably false ... witness ... whose  testimony changed dramatically over the years.""  Yet he now admits that his story matches hers in the 2020 texts (see below). And we know that her story did not change at all, except she added details. There is a huge difference between adding details showing that the relationship was more severe than changing the story. She did not change the story at all. This is a lie.

One leader (who has spoken to the investigator) said that Dr. Brown told him that Sarah saw someone who planted memories in her mind. Not true. He wrote in a follow-up letter to Tikkun about ""how much others have gotten into her ears in recent years or to what extent her memories have changed."" Also not true. Her memories did not change, she merely disclosed more in the past year. One detail—about kiss, kissing on the lips.

Lie #2: Sarah was the aggressor.

Truth #2: In addition to saying that the victims are agents of Satan, Mike is trying to blame both victims. He already told TRR: “Brown reportedly claimed that [Kim] had said something inappropriate that caught him off guard, so he wrote it down.” First, that does not describe what Sarah found in his nightstand. Secondly, it conveniently puts all the blame on a deceased woman, and third, he was forced to admit in light of Ray’s confession that it was far more than that in his vague video “confession.”

Here, he says that he merely responded to Sarah’s affection. In fact, it was Sarah who testified that she was surprised by Mike’s affection for her when he grabbed her hand and held it for several minutes (between 5 and 15?) in a jeep with other students inside. Because her relationship with her dad was so bad, she wondered, “Is this how Fathers treat daughters?” Furthermore, when Mike touched her read end, that was not her (and when her parents found out about it, they went and directly confronted Mike in 2002). When he (by his own admission) put his arm around her late at night (around 2 AM) at Walmart, that was him. How convenient to blame Sarah in a private email to a pastor who probably would not check the facts. And, according to Sarah’s testimony, as she shared with a friend, Mike was physical with her in “trying to kiss me on the lips and pulling me close when I was standing near him. Meaning, wrapping me around my waist area in an inappropriate manner.” (March 24, 2024)

Lie #3: In the text, he says that his wife is furious at all these “new accounts” (again, there’s only one new detail).

Truth #3: Actually, I don’t know which one is the truth, but in his statement, he spoke about him and Nancy wanting to reach out to Sarah in the spirit of Matthew 5:23-26 (which talks about leaving your gift at the altar if someone is offended at you and making things right). The exact words were, “[A]nd my highest priority, as well as Nancy’s, is to have the opportunity to meet together in a setting acceptable to her and bring healing, where I can take full responsibility for the things which apparently hurt her so deeply, things which I thought we addressed 23 years ago.” Privately, he says that Nancy is furious at Sarah’s allegations, but publicly, they say they want to show her love.

Lie #4: Nancy and I met with her, just as I said in my video and statement.

Truth #4: in those texts, which Mike says mirrors his narrative, the only meeting between Mike, Nancy, and Sarah was after she found the erotic notes in his nightstand. After she confronted him, he brought in Nancy, and they told her that she could forgive Mike on behalf of the entire student body (which seems like an effort to keep her from telling anyone else about it— what she did not do for 18 years). This is spiritual abuse. Sarah has maintained that there was no meeting where she said she was uncomfortable with her relationship with Mike, and Mike and Nancy had a good conversation with her. Mike told me that after that conversation, Sarah stayed eight more months and was good. In reality, she left soon after that, and when people asked why and to where Sarah disappeared, Mike and Nancy said she went to Texas to be with her boyfriend… except she had no boyfriend.

Lie #5: “I wanted to make this video since September 13th,” when he found out TRR was investigating him.
Truth #5:  Mike told me and two other leaders that we would not talk about his erotic relationship with “Kim.” He was very clear in his emails to us that he had no intention of discussing that relationship. According to his board, he did not even disclose that relationship to them until he was forced to later that day. Initially, he left it out but had to call each board member later and disclose the relationship with “Kim.”

He told us, “And [Sarah’s situation] the only situation – please trust me on this – that anyone could even try to construe as abusive. We’ll not discuss the [Kim situation] at all.” He tells the pastor he has been eager to make the video since September 13, but in October, he tells us that we will not discuss it at all. Clearly, he is not being honest with the pastor. He had to make the video because the relationship had become public knowledge. As much as he wanted to keep it secret, he could no longer. To be clear, what he told me and two other people was the exact opposite of what he shared with the pastor and the text message. It is disingenuous to mention the board being involved as they were not even told until six weeks after September 13th—on October 26. Should they not have been alerted on September 13 or 14?

Why am I writing this?

Sadly and shockingly, he is not being honest. And this is just one text conversation—five lies. I have many other such communications. But the reason I wrote this is because Dr. Brown does say in this text message to an influential pastor of a large congregation that his story mirrored Sarah’s in 2020. So read for yourself those text messages between Sarah and Kris Bennett in 2020. This is the story that Dr. Michael Brown says happened.

Aren’t you Mike’s friend? Why are you being disloyal?

Actually, I am being extremely loyal to my friend. This began in October when I did what many people reading this might not do. After learning of these two alleged relationships, I reached out to Mike. I gently confronted him and asked him to explain. After he confessed to just about everything with Sarah, except kissing on the lips and what he described as a “sinful soul tie” with “Kim,” I pleaded with him to do the right thing—to go to a team of elders and submit to a process of discipline and restoration.

As I said earlier, I offered to walk with him through the process. It would have been my honor to serve my friend and mentor that way. But he became defiant. Once he became defiant, it was no longer about helping my friend deal with a problematic issue but defending two victims of clergy abuse, one being overtly sexual. And to be clear, as someone wrote the other day, “phone ‘intimacy’ is not an emotional affair. It’s an affair, affair.” But in Kim’s case, it was clergy sexual abuse because Mike was her pastor and trusted leader. Once Mike dug in his heels and was clear that he had no intention of dealing with this in any public sort of way, I became responsible for the information that I had. (Within days, his close associate Tobi Peters sought to intimidate Sarah with text messages, warning her not to come against Mike.)

I was responsible to Sarah—and “Ray” and his family, once he reached out to me. I simply wish that Mike’s response would have been different in October 2024 and that I could be cheering my friend on as he would be coming to the end of a discipline and restoration process. What a joy that would have been. But to stay silent with the knowledge that I had… and then texts, recordings, and other evidence that people began to send me, for me would have been sin (Rom 14:23). My conscience would not allow it.

I still hope that Mike comes out of this stupor and faces reality. There is no “truth” to come out that would exonerate him. But he can come clean and be healed. The Lord loves Mike, not because of his gifts but because he, like all of us, was created in God’s image. But he seems to be hardening his heart. I appeal to him to embrace the truth and begin the process of healing, restoration, and restitution.

Seek the Lord while he may be found;
 call on him while he is near.
Let the wicked forsake their ways
 and the unrighteous their thoughts.
Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them,
 and to our God, for he will freely pardon. (Isaiah 55:6-7)",False,True,False,,2025-03-04T04:07:00.000Z,,@RonSCantor,True

66,0,1,1,"I wrote over 70,000 words, spanning a 15 year career as a motorsport mechanic.

I spoke about my own experiences with the sports lack of diversity. I spoke about the mental health implications for those that travel all season through a gruelling calendar.  I spoke about the death of Jules Bianchi, the impact it had not only on me, and how the safety of the sport has improved as a result. I spoke about a cost cap that is killing the meritocracy of the job market in the sport and driving the best, most valuable personnel into other industries. 

I also spoke about a very personal experience I had relating to the biases and double standards that women face working in the sport. 

I expected, upon the public release of ‘Life In The Pitlane’, that some of these issues raised might garner attention from fans of the sport and those already working in it or aspiring to do so. That’s kinda the idea of writing a book. I tried to be very honest, and also fair, in expressing my views and opinions about the industry, in the hope that it would provide insight and insipre. In doing so, I of course knew that it might also open me up to criticism. 

I also understood that there’d be a small corner of F1 twitter that would, of course, find any opportunity to be critical. 

I want to be unequivocally clear about one thing…

If ANY of the people I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside for the last 15 years, those who understand and have experienced a life in racing, had read my book and expressed concerns or issues with any its content, I would be absolutely mortified.

What I will say is that if you think that taking a 10 second excerpt out of a 15 year career and thinking that it provides you with the insight to offer any opinion of value, you’re sorely mistaken.

1920,40,651,21,"#9 - Persuasion Expert Bets His Career on Shocking COVID Claim

This might be the ultimate “told you so” moment for the “conspiracy theorists.”

JOE ROGAN: “Do you think that someone sat in a room and that people discussed the best ways to get people to comply?”

CHASE HUGHES: “Yes. Oh, yes. I would bet my career because it was executed following textbook protocol.”

Hughes explained that the key sign of a psyop is “if the opinion that’s coming out needs people to be silenced.”

“So if you can’t question it—if you’re supposed to just go along, it’s a psyop,” Hughes reiterated.

During COVID, terms like “disinformation” and “misinformation” flooded the airwaves, but those terms were often weaponized to discredit voices and opinions the government didn’t like.

Doctors like Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, respected scientists at Stanford and Harvard, were silenced simply for challenging lockdowns through the Great Barrington Declaration.

“And it was openly discussed in emails,” Rogan pointed out.

“That’s what’s really crazy. They talked about the strategy of silencing these people, and then you had the actual government itself contacting Twitter, trying to get people removed, which is wild.”

They even went as far as to write headlines like “Mocking anti-vaxxers’ COVID deaths is ghoulish, yes — but may be necessary” (LA Times).

1,0,0,0,"Most product managers struggle to communicate with engineers. It's a costly problem that impacts product delivery, team morale, and career growth. 

The struggle broadly stems from these core areas:
→ No shared technical language and knowledge: Without a shared language or knowledge base, details get lost in translation
→ Different mental models: PMs think in user problems and business outcomes while engineers think in systems and technical constraints
→ Timeline misalignment: PMs see market windows while engineers understand development unpredictability
→ Problem vs solution orientation: Engineers jump to solutions while PMs focus on validating problems

After a decade as a software engineer working with countless PMs, I've seen these communication gaps derail otherwise promising products and timelines.

Building your technical skills and knowledge as a product manager is essential for bridging this gap because as a product manager, it's important that you understand the fundamentals of how software works.

But knowledge alone isn't enough.

What truly transforms your effectiveness is knowing how to apply that knowledge in technical discussions with engineers.

This is why I developed the FAIR framework to guide technical discussions:

F - Feasibility
Evaluates whether a solution can be implemented within current technical constraints.

Ask:
→ What technical limitations might prevent us from implementing this solution?
→ Are there any third-party integrations or APIs we need to consider?
→ How would this approach interact with our existing database structure? 

A - Alternatives
Explores different approaches to solve the same problem and their respective tradeoffs

Ask:
→ Could we achieve similar results with a simpler technical approach?
→ How would each potential solution affect our tech stack differently?
→ Which option gives us the best balance between quick delivery and future flexibility?

I - Impact
Considers both short and long-term effects on the system and business

Ask:
→ Will this solution create bottlenecks in other parts of our system?
→ How might this approach affect our ability to implement future features?
→ What implications does this have for our infrastructure costs as we scale?

R - Risk Mitigation
Identifies potential problems and establishes plans to address them

Ask:
→ What are the most likely points of failure in this implementation?
→ How can we implement monitoring to catch issues before users do?
→ What rollback strategy should we have if unexpected problems arise? 

By approaching discussions with engineers, you're demonstrating your technical leadership as a PM who asks the right questions and provides clarity on what matters.

I unpacked this framework and more insights on the latest Supra Insider podcast with @marcbaselga and @viableben (Link in comments👇)

What frameworks do you use when collaborating with your engineering teams?

The past year has been pretty rough for me. I went through an early 20s-life crisis (is that even a thing...?), took a leap of faith, quit my high-paying corporate tech job in pursuit of a career path I'm more passionate about, and kinda... tripped and fell really hard. 🫠🫠 I haven't had a full-time job for a little more than a year now, and I recently decided I would do what I had originally planned to do a LOT later in my life -- solo indie game development. 

I have been dabbling on this project here and there for a few months now (some artists I closely work with may have already gotten a hint of my project), but I've recently decided I'd treat this project more seriously as a full-time job, as I do want to eventually release the game commercially. Only time will tell if I was the fool who threw away an amazing career in her early 20s, or if following my passion was the right choice after all.

I have also done a lot of contemplation regarding my streaming content as well, and what was originally planned as a small break turned into a pretty long hiatus -- I apologize to my viewers for the radio silence and am forever grateful for you all patiently waiting for me while I sort my life out 🙏🙏 

Please wait a little longer, I plan on resuming streaming activities next month, after sorting out my indie game dev business a bit more! And please patiently wait for more news on my game, I plan on posting more information about it once I feel like it's ready for the public eye!

80,24,14,1,"The most stressful days in our web 3 career so far. Days leading up to TGE combined with a weird crypto environment 😅

Here are my thoughts:

1. Alt coins that dropped recently are performing pretty decent compared to the whole market. There are few tokens people are able to choose to buy considering memecoins and pumpfun has slowed down

2. NO ONE is gonna be able to predict when the majors reversal is gonna start. We are currently at the mercy of Trump. Reminds me or ELON and 2021 cycle where his tweets pumped BTC and DOGE. But he lost his power playing around too much with it. DJT and family will soon be exhausted.

3. Most are selling their crypto now. It’s a good sign of max pain. As mentioned, take profits regularly on pumps to accumulate dips.

4. This cycle is unlike anything else I have seen in my experience. Like many suggested, maybe the concept of cycle is no more?

5. I am sincerely hoping we don’t have another pumpfun token run when cryptos start to run again. Needless to say it’s done enough damage

6. $RDAC plan is going forward and we are positive with our approach and drop and usecases, speculative and non-speculative.

Hard to time the market. Stay safe and keep your mental health in check. Easy to blame yourself for not selling at 4k $ETH or 290 $SOL but max pain is the real opportunity to make $$",False,True,False,,2025-03-04T14:12:00.000Z,,@shanicucic96,True

Then there are players that are labelled ‘wonderkids’ at 14 etc yet fail to reach their potential, which could be down to numerous reasons.

For me JJ is easily in 20 years one of the best young players I’ve either seen/coached or coached against. Musiala, Dembele, Bellingham, Pedri, Gavi, Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly as examples.

1,0,0,0,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Chris Rea (singer, songwriter) (74)

Chris Rea is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist renowned for his distinctive husky voice and a career that spans over four decades. Born on March 4, 1951, in Middlesbrough, England, Rea rose to prominence in the late 1970s with his hit single ""Fool (If You Think It’s Over),"" which showcased his knack for blending soulful melodies with introspective lyrics. His music often fuses rock, blues, and pop influences, with standout albums like The Road to Hell (1989) cementing his reputation for crafting atmospheric, storytelling songs. Perhaps his most universally recognized work is the holiday classic ""Driving Home for Christmas,"" a perennial favorite that captures his ability to evoke warmth and nostalgia. Despite facing health challenges, including a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the early 2000s, Rea has remained a resilient figure in music, continuing to create and perform with a signature style that resonates with fans worldwide.

A transfer from Wisconsin, Wedig started 13 games at right tackle in 2024 for the playoff bound #Indiana team.

He’s played in 45 career games played in college with starts at right tackle, right guard and left guard, and his experience, ideal excellent height (6065v) and length (8168v wing), and efficiency as a pass blocker will be appealing as an NFL swing tackle.

135,9,3,4,"Few folks reached out with PIP concerns, so here's my note on the same:

I went through a PIP
in early half of my career ~2014

I was put in there primarily because I criticized a company decision in an org-wide-email which made a VP look bad

I didn't know how to behave in large orgs, how managing optics is almost everything 

during the PIP I worked 3 months of 14 hrs/day including weekends

and then

I cleared the PIP, my manager was happy

next month I resigned as soon as I got a decent offer, because I felt I can't risk being there anymore 

generally PIPs wreck your confidence & that pushes you into an all or nothing mode

I could've stayed longer at the place, but I felt it wasn't worth building up my reputation from a position of handicap

in reality it was likely my all-or-nothing thinking playing out:
at the hint of you don't like me, I'll abandon you, before you abandon me

I had actually done a cool thing, changed someone's opinion of me in a high pressure context

a more mature me could've chosen to ride this momentum to more growth

but I was blind to my adhd & also I was reasonably good at job search

so I could choose the easier path of moving to a new job to start from scratch

but there's a lot wisdom you acquire when you survive & thrive in an imperfect environment

I missed that learning because I chose the easier path

I think most people don't talk about PIPs they've been through to avoid negative bias from future hiring managers

so we think they don't happen at all, but I think especially in last few years a few silent layoffs have been driven by this very tool

wish more people will talk about this organisational tool, which as many senior folks say, is often very effective when used in the right context",False,True,False,,2025-03-03T06:42:00.000Z,,@amuldotexe,True

Your current job pays your bills (unless you have legacy money). Like it or not, be excellent at it. The better you are, the more leverage you have.

If you want to switch to a role you actually like, start by making yourself a star where you are. No company will move a struggling employee to a different role.

Learn the skills for your desired role. Find mentors. Volunteer for projects in that function. Prove your value before you ask for a switch.

176,11,27,0,"There’s something different in the air when Luka Dončić faces the Los Angeles Clippers. 

Dončić has now played 39 career games against the Clippers.

In 20 regular season games against the Clippers, his averages are absurd:

🔸 32.3 PTS
🔸 7.9 REB
🔸 7.4 AST
🔸 1.6 STL

He averages more points against the Clippers than any other opponent he’s played at least 10 times. And he gets even better tin the playoffs.

In 19 playoff games against the Clippers, Dončić averages:

🔸 32.4 PTS
🔸 8.8 REB
🔸 9.5 AST
🔸 1.2 STL

Luka has seen the Clippers in the playoffs 3 times in the last 5 seasons, finally getting over the hump in the 2024 postseason and advancing all the way to the NBA Finals. 

“That’s what I like,” Dončić told ClutchPoints. “To me, that’s fun, and that’s how I get going, especially on the basketball court.” 

Something about the Clippers wakes up the inner demon inside Luka.
